# MRI Diagnosis Project

This project uses neural networks (PyTorch) to analyze MRI images and provide diagnoses.

## Structure
- `data/` - Place your MRI images and labels here.
- `models/` - Neural network model definitions and checkpoints.
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for experiments and analysis.

## Setup
1. Python 3.8+ and virtual environment recommended.
2. Required packages: torch, torchvision, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn.

## Usage
- Add your MRI dataset to the `data/` folder.
- Use the notebooks in `notebooks/` to train and evaluate models.

## Note
Replace placeholder data and code with your actual dataset and requirements.
