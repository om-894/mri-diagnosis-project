## Overview

A deep learning-based system for automated diagnosis and classification of neurological conditions from MRI scans. This project leverages state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks implemented in PyTorch to assist medical professionals in the early detection and classification of brain abnormalities.

## Key Features

- Preprocessing pipeline for MRI scan normalization and augmentation
- Custom PyTorch models optimized for 3D medical imaging
- Interactive Jupyter notebooks for visualization and analysis
- Comprehensive evaluation metrics including sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score
- Model interpretability tools to highlight regions of interest

## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: PyTorch
- **Data Processing**: NumPy, Pandas, SimpleITK
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Development**: Jupyter, Git

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mri-diagnosis-project.git
cd mri-diagnosis-project

# Create and activate virtual environment (optional)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```python
from src.models import BrainMRIClassifier
from src.preprocessing import preprocess_scan

# Load and preprocess a scan
preprocessed_scan = preprocess_scan('path/to/scan.nii')

# Load a pretrained model
model = BrainMRIClassifier.load_from_checkpoint('models/best_model.pth')

# Get prediction
prediction = model.predict(preprocessed_scan)
print(f"Diagnosis: {prediction}")
```

## Results

The model achieves 94% accuracy on the test dataset, with 92% sensitivity and 95% specificity for detecting abnormalities. Detailed performance metrics and validation results are available in the `notebooks/model_evaluation.ipynb` notebook.

## Future Improvements

- Implement additional model architectures (ResNet3D, DenseNet3D)
- Add support for multi-modal imaging (combining T1, T2, FLAIR)
- Develop explainable AI components for clinical decision support
- Optimize for deployment in resource-constrained environments
